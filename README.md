# ANIMAL-INTRUSION-DETECTION-SYSTEM
This repository contains information about the project- Animal Intrusion Detection System

<h3> <b> Problem Statement </b> </h3>

<p>

With rapid increase in deforestation and depletion ecosystems animals are finding it hard to live in its natural habitat, there are numerous incidents that take place where animals get out of their enclosure in search of food.

 <br>
 
 These incidents almost always end by the animals getting hurt due to the voluntary action by the humans or by the animals getting in the middle of a dangerous human activity. So, we came up with the idea of creating an animal intrusion detection using image processing as a solution.

 <br>
 
With growing security systems, it is easy to find cctv cameras in every establishment. Even if there are no cameras, installing one does not cost you much. These optical systems capture intrusion and keep your belongings safe. But along with capturing intrusion it can also be made to detect animal or human intrusion.
 
<br>
 
Detecting animal intrusion using image processing will help the system to send out an alert to the residents nearby and take precautions. This kind of real time alert can avoid animal accidents and also can help the residents take quick actions to solve the situation.
